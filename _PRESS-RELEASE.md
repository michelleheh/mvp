There is an approach called "working backwards" that is widely used at Amazon. They work backwards from the customer, rather than starting with an idea for a product and trying to bolt customers onto it. While working backwards can be applied to any specific product decision, using this approach is especially important when developing new products or features.

For new initiatives a product manager typically starts by writing an internal press release announcing the finished product. The target audience for the press release is the new/updated product's customers, which can be retail customers or internal users of a tool or technology. Internal press releases are centered around the customer problem, how current solutions (internal or external) fail, and how the new product will blow away existing solutions.

If the benefits listed don't sound very interesting or exciting to customers, then perhaps they're not (and shouldn't be built). Instead, the product manager should keep iterating on the press release until they've come up with benefits that actually sound like benefits. Iterating on a press release is a lot less expensive than iterating on the product itself (and quicker!).

If the press release is more than a page and a half, it is probably too long. Keep it simple. 3-4 sentences for most paragraphs. Cut out the fat. Don't make it into a spec. You can accompany the press release with a FAQ that answers all of the other business or execution questions so the press release can stay focused on what the customer gets. My rule of thumb is that if the press release is hard to write, then the product is probably going to suck. Keep working at it until the outline for each paragraph flows. 

Oh, and I also like to write press-releases in what I call "Oprah-speak" for mainstream consumer products. Imagine you're sitting on Oprah's couch and have just explained the product to her, and then you listen as she explains it to her audience. That's "Oprah-speak", not "Geek-speak".

Once the project moves into development, the press release can be used as a touchstone; a guiding light. The product team can ask themselves, "Are we building what is in the press release?" If they find they're spending time building things that aren't in the press release (overbuilding), they need to ask themselves why. This keeps product development focused on achieving the customer benefits and not building extraneous stuff that takes longer to build, takes resources to maintain, and doesn't provide real customer benefit (at least not enough to warrant inclusion in the press release).

## Heading ##
  > Name the product in a way the reader (i.e. your target customers) will understand.
  my personal project manager

## Sub-Heading ##
  > Describe who the market for the product is and what benefit they get. One sentence only underneath the title.
  You are able to keep track of the progress personal projects (wedding planning, kitchen remodeling, building a drome, learn a skill) you are currently working on. Set reminders and gather resources to help you stay on track.

## Summary ##
  > Give a summary of the product and the benefit. Assume the reader will not read anything else so make this paragraph good.
  - help plan out milestones for completing a project by setting up deadlines
  - overview of projecet progress
  - set reminders to keep progress on track
  - keep all your project related resources in one place
  - future features: working with other people

## Problem ##
  > Describe the problem your product solves.
  - current todo lists are largly scattered, and hard to keep track of if a tacks spans a long period of time or require more than one person to complete.

## Solution ##
  > Describe how your product elegantly solves the problem.
  - by keeping tasks in a project, the app will help relate small tasks to a larger project
  - by providing a timeline interface, the app provides a good overview of the tasks to be completed
  - by enableing different users to a specific project, the manager of the project can delegate to multiple people

## Quote from You ##
  > A quote from a spokesperson in your company.
  "Let my personal project manager help you manage your next dream."

## How to Get Started ##
  > Describe how easy it is to get started.
  - loging with your google account

## Customer Quote ##
  > Provide a quote from a hypothetical customer that describes how they experienced the benefit.
  "it's great that I can see all my dress ideas for my wedding and keeping track of appointments in one place!"

## Closing and Call to Action ##
  > Wrap it up and give pointers where the reader should go next.
  "get started now!"
